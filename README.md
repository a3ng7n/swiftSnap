swiftSnap
=========
Blender 3D addon for creating snappyHexMeshDict and associated files for OpenFOAM's snappyHexMesh application. Find more info on openfoamwiki.net

This version is compatible with Blender 2.62. It is fairly easy to change it for use with 2.63. Look for comments on a few lines in __init__.py
